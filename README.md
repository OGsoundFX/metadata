# What is this metadata project ??? :monocle_face:

It's a small **Nodejs** app that does 2 things:
* Replace the whitespace and "-" characters with "-" (underscores) from all filenames contained in a folder
* Fetch all the metadata you need from thes files and store them in a **JSON** file

### But Why ??? :woman_shrugging:

Short answer: Because I needed it :nerd_face:
<br>
I often need to upload a large number of **sound effect audio tracks** to in order to add them to my catalogue in my **Sound Effect online shop: [BamSFX.com](https://www.bamsfx.com)**
<br>
* My first **problem** was: all my track names contain whitespaces :facepalm:
* My second **problem** was: I need seed my database with all the information from these tracks, and fortunately a lot of it is stored as **metadata**. I just need to reach it, store it in a **JSON** file that I can later use to seed my **Ruby on Rails app [BamSFX.com](https://www.bamsfx.com)**

### So how did I do it ??? :raised_eyebrow:
I created this little **nodeJS** app that solves both problems :sunglasses:

### Then how does it work ??? :hushed:

I'll let you know in a bit... (coming soon).
